# Hi and welcome, my GitHub has projects in the following categories:

- Personal Projects
- Professional Toolbox 

Day to day I work in private repos within GitLab/GitHub spanning both Vue and React stacks.

----

## Personal Projects 

### Node APIs

  - Aggregated news api providing the latest potentially price sensitive crypto news. Built using Puppeteer to scrape the web, each news item contains:
    - Title
    - Link
    - Description
    - Source 

### Full-Stack JavaScript:

  - MERN (Next)
    - **Vulcon** (private but interest is welcome) A long term project providing Crypto on-chain analysis, charting, trading and DeFi tools   
  - Vue 3 + Firebase
    - **ProDev** Built as an SPA and uses Bootstrap 5, GSAP, date-fns
    - **Portfolio** Also built as an SPA but includes **SASS** and **marked**, the markdown previewer
  - Static
    - **ProDev Build Guide** This static site was built with Vitepress and hosted on Netlify   
  
### Front-End HTML | CSS | JS 

  - **Trader Dashboards** Built leveraging the amazing TradingView charts pulling in real-time and end of day data from a range of providers including live news feed and economic calendar. 

## Professional R&D and Toolboxes 

Individual feature development I usually share in public repos, then I have both the `Back-End` and `Front-End` repos which are a vast vault of modelled patterns and best practices which I use as go-to toolboxes day to day.

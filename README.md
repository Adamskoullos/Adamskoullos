## Hi and welcome, my GitHub has projects in the following categories:

  - Vue 3 + Firebase
    - **ProDev** Built as an SPA and uses Bootstrap 5, GSAP, date-fns
    - **Portfolio** Also built as an SPA but includes **SASS** and **marked**, the markdown previewer
  - Jamstack
    - **ProDev Build Guide** This static site was built with Vitepress and hosted on Netlify   

## Full-Stack JavaScript | Python:

  - Nuxt + Flask (Currently working on individual moving parts ahead of pulling the project together)
  - Nuxt + Django (Coming soon)
  
## Front-End HTML | CSS | JS | jQuery | Ajax

  - **Trader Dashboards** Built leveraging the amazing TradingView charts pulling in real-time and end of data from a range of providers including live news feed and economic calendar. 


## Pattern modelling repos: 
These are markdown guides used to map patterns to be used as a reference when building projects. I like to build these as I am learning an area to reinforce my understanding. 

## Working repos
These range from practice projects, to specific component development and testing, to blog posts.
You will also find my **coding-dojo** where I go to work on and save interesting problems and solutions. If you have a minute check out the **FCC/projects** folder within **coding-dojo** to see my solutions for the 5 FreeCodeCamp challenges that earnt me the Algorithms & Data Structures certificate. In fact please right click this [link](https://github1s.com/Adamskoullos/Coding-Dojo/blob/master/fcc/projects/cashRegister.js) to open directly in the browser.
